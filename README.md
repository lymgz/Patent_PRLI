## Claim
This repository is used to show part of the paper to calculate and generate the process of the figure, it is worth noting that the final generation of the figure in the paper, but also used, including, EXCEL, OriginPro, Vosview and other tools. Therefore, the final presentation is based on the content of the paper.

## Figure 13: evolution path tracing folder
1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program.
2. The author is using python 3.10.9
3. The " evolution path tracing" folder shows figure 13 in section 4.
4. The program is used to calculate the scattering position of the bubble chart, the specific steps are shown in subsection 3.5 of this paper.

## Table 3: Semantic similarity folder
1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program.
2. The author is using python 3.10.9
3. A file "sematic similarity 4 N-gram.ipynb" in "semantic similarity" folder shows Table 3 in section 5.
4. To calculated the Cosine Similarity Score/Euclidean Distance Score/Jaccard Similarity Score

## Figure 16: Semantic similarity folder
1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program.
2. The author is using python 3.10.9
3.  A file "sematic similarity 1 LDA.ipynb" in "semantic similarity" folder shows Figure 16 in section 5.

## Figure 17 : Comparison_of_topicwizard_algorithms floder
Code for journal paper manuscript titled"Technology Status Tracing and Trends of Construction Robotics: A Patent Analysis"
1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program.
2. The author is using python 3.10.9
3. The "Comparison_of_topicwizard_algorithms" folder shows figure 17 in section 5 of the paper;
4. because the topic-wizard toolkit has rich extended functions, and cannot be shown in the paper due to the limitation of space, so the reviewer can extend it in the software.
