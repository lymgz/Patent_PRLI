1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program. 2. The author is using python 3.10.9.
2. The "Comparison_of_topicwizard_algorithms" folder shows figure 17 in section 5 of the paper; because the topic-wizard toolkit has rich extended functions, and cannot be shown in the paper due to the limitation of space, so the reviewer can extend it in the software.
