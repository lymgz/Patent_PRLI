## Claim
This repository is used to present part of the paper calculating and generating the process of the figures and table, it is worth noting that the final generation of the figure in the paper, but also used, including, EXCEL, OriginPro, Vosview and other tools. Therefore, the final presentation is based on the content of the paper.The files have been successfully run on the author's computer.

## Figure 13: evolution path tracing folder
1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program.
2. The author's python environment is 3.10.9 with CPU intel i9, memory 16G.
3. The " evolution path tracing" folder shows figure 13 in section 4.
4. The program is used to calculate the scattering position of the bubble chart, the specific steps are shown in subsection 3.5 of this paper.

## Figure 17 : Comparison_of_topicwizard_algorithms floder
Code for journal paper manuscript titled"Technology Status Tracing and Trends of Construction Robotics: A Patent Analysis"
1. Reviewers are requested to download the file to their local hard disk and run the jupyter notebook program.
2. The author's python environment is 3.10.9 with CPU intel i9, memory 16G.
3. The "Comparison_of_topicwizard_algorithms" folder shows figure 17 in section 5 of the paper;
4. because the topic-wizard toolkit has rich extended functions, and cannot be shown in the paper due to the limitation of space, so the reviewer can extend it in the software.
